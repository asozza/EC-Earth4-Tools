Ocean Spin-uP acceleratoR for Earth climatologY
```

# OSPREY

## Overview

The "Ocean Spin-uP acceleratoR for Earth climatologY" (OSPREY) is a suite of tools for accelerating the ocean spin-up in climate simulations.

## Installation

## Documentation

The code is divided into ? groups of functions

- [ ] io: input/output funtions for reading and writing
- [ ] means: mathematical operations
- [ ] tools: management
- [ ] actions: 
- [ ] checks: 
- [ ] graphs: 
- [ ] diagnostics:

## Examples

## Open Issues

- [ ] Merger of long run using multiple simulations (in tools?)
- [ ] append new data on existing averaged file
- [ ] using subvariables like thetao-mix, thetao-pyc, thetao-aby
- [ ] Option for saving figures or displaying graphics on the notebook
- [ ] plots of monthly variability (JFMAMJJASOND) (in graphics)
- [ ] Water Column Stabilizer (in actions)
- [ ] energy spectrum for the global ocean (in graphics and means)
- [ ] launcher for graphics, build a diagnostics command.
- [ ] add folders: io/means/tools/actions/checks/graphs/diagnostics
